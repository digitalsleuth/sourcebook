The purpose of this repo is to provide a location for useful DFIR knowledge, such as data structures and formats, tools used for analysis, and references for additional research.

One of the biggest challenges with online resources nowadays (including even this repo), is that one day the site that you refer to regularly is up and functioning fine, and the next it's gone.

With this repo, my plan is to make a DFIR resource that can be regularly synced (pulled) to ensure that the information contained in all of these external resources can be retained.
